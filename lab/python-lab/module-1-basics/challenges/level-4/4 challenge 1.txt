## Level 4 - Challenge 1

Problem
Take three numbers from the user and print their average.

Instructions
1. Ask the user to enter three numbers.
2. Convert them to integers.
3. Add the three numbers.

5. Print the average.

Example Input

6

Example Output
5.0

Hint
Average = (a + b + c) / 3

Broken Code
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))
avg = a + b + c / 3
print(avg)

Correct Code
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))
avg = (a + b + c) / 3
print(avg)
