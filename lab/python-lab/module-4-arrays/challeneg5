# Module 4 - Arrays
## Level 3 - Challenge 1

Problem
Find the smallest number in an array.

Instructions
1. Create an array with numbers.
2. Compare elements.
3. Print the smallest number.

Example Array
[7, 3, 9, 1, 5]

Example Output
1

Hint
Store the first element as smallest and compare with others.

Broken Code
arr = [7,3,9,1,5]
smallest = arr[0]

for i in arr:
if i < smallest:
smallest = i

print(smallest)

Correct Code
arr = [7,3,9,1,5]
smallest = arr[0]

for i in arr:
    if i < smallest:
        smallest = i

print(smallest)
