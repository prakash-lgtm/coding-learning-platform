# Module 4 - Arrays
## Level 2 - Challenge 1

Problem
Print all elements of an array.

Instructions
1. Create an array with numbers.
2. Use a loop to print each element.

Example Array
[2, 4, 6, 8]

Example Output
2
4
6
8

Hint
Use a for loop to iterate through the array.

Broken Code
arr = [2,4,6,8]

for i in arr
print(i)

Correct Code
arr = [2,4,6,8]

for i in arr:
    print(i)
